**28th January 2015**

> Info:
> - This session is in context to large scale games, that are build for High-End Desktops and Gaming Consoles.
> - Most games are written in C++ and Java, while using a variety of scripting languages, and assembly to access hardware.

## The Process

### Allocating Engines Needed
Recognize the different types of engines required:
- Audio
- Video
- Intelligence
- Rendering
- Cut scene
- Story
and much more

Big organizations use their own custom engines that has everything they need. Like [RAGE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine), [UDK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine), [CryEngine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryEngine), [FrostBite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite_%28game_engine%29), etc.

### Preparing Algorithm

Mathematical computations that predict what a player will do against the AI, an objective, or whether or not a player has met a certain criteria for X, and similar.

### Defining Systems

- Version control: [Alienbrain](http://www.alienbrain.com/) and [Perforce](http://www.perforce.com/)

- Manage design of game:

- Art Tools: Zbrush, Maya, or Mudbox.

- Engineers: Visual Studio
They might even leverage Autodesks new game development tools such as Scaleform, Beast, Kynapse, HumanIK.
